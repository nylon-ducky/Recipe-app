This is a recipe app I made. I wanted to do something with a database, so I made this. It uses a MySQL database and PHP. Users can add a recipe to the database using a form, and it automatically displays on the home screen. I also used the Edamam API so users could look up actual recipes they might enjoy. Edamam doesn't include instructions to the recipes, but it does include ingredients, dietary constraints that the dishes fit into and links to the original recipe posters website. Each recipe is displayed in a card and the search bar works for the Edamam API. IF a user makes a search, any results that come up will be from the APi.
