I'm currently learning more and more about accessibility and wanted to start a new project where accessibility is the main focus.

Today I committed myself to using a screen reader on all my devices for some amount of time. I made it 3 and a half hours. 
The rules were:

1: 
I could not use a mouse right away. I had to try using just the keyboard for a little while first.

2:
I couldnt change my patterns or destinations or avoid certain activities because of this experiment.

3:
I had to use some screen reader on any and all devices. I really only use my phone and laptop, so for a windows 10 laptop, I used Narrator. The default pre-installed screen reader. Then for my phone (android version 9) I used TalkBack which is also the default, pre-installed screen reader.

It was really fun and relatively difficult, but towords the end, I had gotten used to it a little and could do most things with relative ease. 

Some things I struggled with:

Using google on my laptop, I would normally type anything I'm looking up into the address bar, but that was a no-go during this period. It's probably totally possible, but I found that it was easier to type into the actual google search bar on my homescreen.

browsing the web on my phone was rather difficult, and in fact, that's what made me want to stop. I was loosing too much productivity to continue. Being somewhat of a first time user, the process of doing anything was much slower, and some of the normal actions I would normally do, were not possible. Things like swiping down to see and adjust screen brightness or access my calculator or my settings was not do-able. So I did use google voice commands for some things, but towords the end, i realized there was a small arrow to act as the swipe up function to see all my apps, and was able to use that.

Overall, it was an enlightening experience and somewhat productive in it's self. I now realize how much of a struggle it can be to use these things and if it's a new need for you, it wont be easy right off the bat. Also, it was really enlightening to see just how awkward navigating some of these sites can be using only the keyboard. Elements can be positioned oddly and there are plenty of non visible things that screen readers pick up that maybe shouldnt be.

I'm very excited to start an accessibility centered project. I'm not sure exactly what it'll be yet, but I know where I'm going to start!


I wound up turning this into a recipe app because I looked at some recipe apps that were totally unaccessible. so the original vision kind of got lost, but it was still a pretty cool project to build.
